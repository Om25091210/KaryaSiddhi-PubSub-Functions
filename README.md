##‘KaryaSiddhi’

A task management system like ‘KaryaSiddhi’ is specifically designed to assist the Police Department in identifying areas for improvement, planning better duties for individuals, maintaining work records, and tracking officers’ true performance with accurate visual data. Now, the question arises—why should we not opt for general task management platforms like Asana, Keka, Smartsheet, and Monday.com?

The police department operates differently from a corporate culture, with a hierarchy ranging from constables to the Director General of Police. They require a simple interface and functionality tailored to their unique work environment. Unlike the corporate world, where employees may spend hours in front of digital products, police officers engage more in fieldwork. Through our surveys within the department, we identified several common issues. The most frequent problems included not receiving proper recognition for work and poor management of officers. Although the total capacity at the police station was 12, the actual number of active officers on paper was around 41. This discrepancy became evident when additional police force was needed during emergencies.

When we proposed the idea to higher-ranking officers such as the CSP and SP, they showed interest and assisted us in gathering information on various work categories and designing our approach for the system. One significant challenge we faced was increasing the engagement rate with our system. We needed to determine what factors to consider to ensure officers would use our system more frequently to add and approve tasks.

The documentation offers a detailed overview of the system setup, incorporating real-world scenarios, and outlines a development roadmap. The "KaryaSiddhi" project embodies a comprehensive approach designed to enhance the efficiency of police department operations.
